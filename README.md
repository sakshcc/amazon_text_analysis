## 💬 Amazon Product Review Analysis
This project explores customer reviews from Amazon to understand what people are saying and how they feel about different products. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, I performed sentiment analysis and topic modeling to break down thousands of reviews into actionable insights.

The goal was to automate the process of understanding large volumes of customer opinions using tools like TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK, spaCy
- Scikit-learn
- Gensim (for LDA)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- WordCloud

## 🔍 Key Techniques Used
- Text cleaning (stopwords, lemmatization, punctuation removal)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Sentiment classification with Logistic Regression
- Topic modeling using LDA
- Word clouds and charts to visualize insights

## 📈 What I Found
- Most customers leaned toward positive sentiment overall, but there were noticeable dips in satisfaction around delivery delays and product quality.
- LDA revealed topics related to shipping, packaging, and product performance.
- Visualizations helped uncover how customer sentiment shifted across different topics.
